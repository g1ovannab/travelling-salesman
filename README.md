# TSP

In order to run the program, you need to have the JDK 11 installed.


## Files Structure

You need to create the file `cities.txt` in the folder /files with the coordinates of the cities you want to calculate.

If you don't want to write any numbers, you need to set the variable 'runTest' to true, and set a number of cities in the variable 'numberOfCities'.

The results will be placed also in the folder /files, in a text file called `statistics.txt`.

If the program returns any error, the error will be written in the file `error.txt`.
